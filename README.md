# colore
This is an archive of ontologies (sets of rules and facts about a topic) written using a 
Common Logic syntax (see https://github.com/ ) 
It was automatically exported from code.google.com/p/colore, (I thin that the official 
copy is probably at https://github.com/gruninger/colore also check out https://github.com/tillmo/colore )
